        Here's a fact: there is a current dichotomy between nature and technology in today’s world, caused by
        sustainability issues, increased time spent on screens and urban developement. How can we reinforce a positive
        relationship between humans and nature, and could we view this through an interaction lens?

        Bio-Interfaces is an exploratory and speculative project that facilitates tangible interactions through plants
        as mediating interfaces. It explores how every human’s inherent biophilia can be utilised to enable further
        opportunities for human-plant communication and connection. Ultimately, how can more poetic and nurturing
        mindsets towards nature be encouraged?

      <span class="proj1">
        This research takes the format of a critical journal led by experimental and explorative strategies and
        supported by notions of discursive design and speculative thinking. Primary research consisted of interviews,
        surveys and observation exercises.

        <br><br>
        The most fundamental methodology used within this critical journal framework was the creation of a series of
        experiments that developed Living Media Interfaces based on insights gathered from primary research.
        This methodology of conducting experiments emphasises the value of the process and developing a thorough
        understanding of the subject matter, driven by motives of inherent curiosity.

        The project began with a series of experiments looking into various manifestations of tangible human-plant

        system, and relevant interrelationships.

        This first prototype aims to discover ways to create meaningful and personal connections with nature via
        Human-Plant Interaction.

        One way to do so is by humanising or attributing some level of
        sentience to the plants, explored through the physical representation of a visual language, something akin to a
        human using handwriting to communicate or express themself.

        It consists of a plant connected to a pen plotter. When you touch the plant, the axidraw moves in response,
        drawing ellipses. The more intensity you touch the plant with, the larger the ellipse, and vice versa. This sets
        up a dialogue or conversation where you and the plant are responding to each other.
